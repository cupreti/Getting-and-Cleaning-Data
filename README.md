# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
## This repository contains the course project for Cousera Data Science course Getting and Cleaning Data 
### Main objective of this project is: 
### 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

    download()
    run.analysis()
    
    This will download the data and run the run analysis function
    
    If the data is already downloaded, copy to the current working directory and run as below
    
    source("./run_analysis.R")
    run.analysis()
